          The word &quot;kiwi&quot; often brings to mind the image of
          something small, brown, fuzzy, and found in the produce
          section
        </span>
          <span class="para2">
          of your local supermarket. But the kiwi is not a fruit—that&#039;s
          kiwifruit, which is native to eastern Asia! About the size of a
          chicken, the kiwi is a small, flightless, and nearly wingless bird
          found only in New Zealand.

    <div class="HABITAT-AND-DIET">
      The kiwi lives in forested areas of New Zealand that tend to be very
      steep and wet, surrounded by shrubs and trees found nowhere else on
      Earth. Since it is not able to fly up into trees to nest, rest, or
      escape from danger, the kiwi makes its home in burrows in the ground of
      its swampy forest or grassland habitat. The bird digs multiple burrows
      within its territory, using strong toes and claws. Nest burrows, dug
      early in the season, become overgrown at the entrance to provide great
      camouflage by the time the female is ready to lay her eggs.

    <div class="FAMILY-LIFE">
      Kiwi pairs use gentle grunts and snuffles with each other and their
      chicks, and males purr during mating. Pairs do fight, and the larger
      female may kick the male away if she is not in the mood for his company.
      If another kiwi invades a pair's territory, a kicking fight ensues, and
      kiwis have been known to fight to the death, although this is rare.
      <br>
      <br>
      An
      adult male and female kiwi typically pair for life, but a female may
      choose a new male if a more desirable one wanders by. The male
      doesn&#039;t have beautiful songs or fancy feathers to attract a female.
      Instead, he follows one around constantly while grunting. If she&#039;s
      not interested, the female might wander off or try to scare him away.
      <br>
      Breeding
      season is late winter to early summer. Nests might be in hollow logs or
      in underground burrows dug by the male.
      <br>
      <br>
      The female kiwi lays
      up to six eggs every year. Kiwi eggs are smooth and white, off-white, or
      pale green in color. They are also huge in comparison to the mother: one
      egg might reach up to 20 percent of her weight; that would be like a
      120-pound (54 kilograms) human female giving birth to a 24-pound (11
      kilograms) baby! Compared to the relative weights of other birds and
      their eggs, the female kiwi should weigh about 31 pounds (14 kilograms)
      rather than its typical weight of 2 to 8 pounds (0.9 to 3.6 kilograms).
